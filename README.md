# Elims Solutions — Development & IT Consulting

Welcome to Elims Solutions. We are a development and IT consulting enterprise focused on delivering reliable, scalable, and secure software and cloud solutions for growth-minded organizations.

Our goal is to help businesses accelerate digital initiatives, reduce risk, and build maintainable technology that supports long-term goals.

## What we do

- Custom Software Development
  - Web, mobile, and backend systems tailored to your business needs
  - Modern architectures: microservices, serverless, event-driven systems

- Cloud Architecture & DevOps
  - Cloud migrations and cost optimization (AWS / Azure / GCP)
  - CI/CD, infrastructure as code, monitoring and observability

- Product & Technical Strategy
  - Technical due diligence, roadmaps, and architecture design
  - MVPs, prototyping, and product discovery workshops

- Data & Machine Learning
  - Data engineering, pipelines, analytics, and applied ML/AI solutions

- Security & Compliance
  - Secure-by-design implementations, threat modeling, and compliance guidance (GDPR, SOC2, etc.)

- Managed Services & Support
  - Ongoing application and platform support, incident response, and SLA-based maintenance

## How we work

1. Discovery — Understand the problem, stakeholders and constraints.
2. Plan — Propose scope, milestones, and metrics for success.
3. Build — Deliver iterative increments with continuous feedback.
4. Validate — Test, secure, and measure against agreed outcomes.
5. Operate & Improve — Support, monitor, and evolve the solution.

We favor short feedback loops, automated testing, and pragmatic documentation so teams can move quickly while keeping technical debt under control.

## Engagement models

- Fixed-price for well-defined projects
- Time & materials for discovery, R&D, and evolving scopes
- Dedicated teams or staff augmentation for long-term partnerships
- Retainers for managed services and support

## Technologies we commonly use

- Languages: JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, Java
- Frontend: React, Vue, Svelte
- Backend: Node.js, FastAPI, Spring Boot, gRPC
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis
- Cloud: AWS / Azure / GCP, Kubernetes, Terraform, Serverless
- CI/CD & Observability: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog

If you use different technologies, we’ll adapt — our main focus is delivering value.

## Case studies (examples)

- Rapid MVP for a fintech startup: 3-month delivery from concept to production, integrated payments and strong compliance baseline.
- Cloud migration for a mid-market SaaS: reduced monthly infra cost by 35% while improving availability and autoscaling.
- Data platform for retail analytics: built ETL pipelines and dashboards enabling real-time inventory insights.

(We are happy to share public case studies or references on request.)
